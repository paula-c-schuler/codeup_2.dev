	<h3>Ebey Landing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The best time to visit? It is possible to visit the Reserve year round due to Whidbey Island's mild maritime climate. <br>
			The rain shadow effect of the nearby Olympic Mountains means little annual rain falls in the Reserve, yet it spreads <br>
			itself out remarkably. 
		</li>
		<li>If you have limited time, be sure to visit historic Front Street in the town of Coupeville, <br>
			and the beach at Ebeyâ€™s Landing, where you can hike the Bluff Trail.
		</li>
		<li>The Reserve is a unique unit of the National Park Service - a partnership (federal, state, town & county) <br>
			that offers support to the current community in the preservation of their cultural and natural legacy
		</li>
		<li>No landscape in the Puget Sound country preserves such direct connections to as many layers of <br>
			Northwest history as Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve - Coast Salish peoples, English explorers <r>
			and traders, American farmers and sea captains, and even Chinese farmers.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Mount Ranier National Park</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Mount Rainier National Park encompasses 236,381.49 acres or 369.35 square miles within the legislative <br>
			park boundary, with an additional 140 acres lying outside the boundary. 
		</li>
		<li>Generally, 1.5 - 2 million people visit Mount Rainier each year, In 2014, the park had 1,875,651 visitors.
		</li>
		<li>The park is open all year, but some areas of the park, including Sunrise, White River, Ohanapecosh, State <br>
			Routes 410 and 123, and the Stevens Canyon Road close for the season in mid-October or early-November and <br>
			do not reopen until summer.
		</li>
		<li>New research indicates Mount Rainier is far more active than previously believed. We now understand there<br> 
		are risks associated with the volcano and its glaciers that require visitors and staff to be aware and prepared. 
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Olympic National Park</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Diversity is the hallmark of Olympic National Park. From the lush canopy of the rain forests, to the sandy <br>
			beaches of the coast, to the majestic overlooks of the rugged, glacier-capped mountains, Olympic National<br>
			 Park has a great deal to offer.
		</li>
		<li>Forests blanket most of the park's low and middle elevations; temperate rainforest is found on the park's <br>
		west-facing slopes and valleys. Higher up, the forests give way to clumps of trees among the subalpine meadows.
		</li>
		<li>Roads and short trails provide access to much of Olympic's 72-mile wilderness coast.
		</li>
		<li>Opportunities to connect with Elwha River Restoration await your discovery. The largest dam removal in United <br>
		States history began September 2011.
		</li>
