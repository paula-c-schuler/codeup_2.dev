				<h2>Scary Facts about the Nasty Evil Death Star</h2>
					<div class="icons"><img src="/img/littlestdeathstar.png"></div>
					<p>The Superlaser is the Death Star's main weapon.</p>
					<p>The Superlaser is created by coordinating eight  
						lasers manned by 168 gunners located in the Eye of the ship.</p>
					<p>The Eye of the ship is a circular concave shape built around a focusing crystal.</p>
					<p>The Eye has no defenses and requires military backup for protection.</p>
					<div class="icons"><img src="/img/littlestdeathstar.png"></div>
					<p>The Equatorial Trench is the large deep channel along the equator of the vessel.<br>
						It contains many of the main systems including: <br>Landing bays, drive thrusters and tractor beams.</p>
					<p>The surface of the Death Star is covered with thousands of buildings <br>so it looks like a massive city.</p>
					<p>Mooring Towers dock large capital ships, from which the malicious malingering commander would sometimes control the fleet.</p>

				There is a vertical-align:baseline in the CSS for this element. Is that why
				the main's bottom is aligning with the bottom of the text in the aside element?
				<p>Ah, apparently it is because after adding the questions, the aside element
					moved up to a more desired location. How do I fix this? </p>
